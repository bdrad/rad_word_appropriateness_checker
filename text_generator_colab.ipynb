            "The use of an air gap in place of a high ratio anti-scatter grid for scatter reduction therefore results in a lower radiation dose requirement 2.If the object-image distance is increased without increasing the source image distance, the patient would be positioned much closer to the x-ray source, which would result in the radiation dose being increased in accordance with the inverse square law.\n",
